# Multiset data structures

A set is an unordered collection of objects. Duplicate elements are not possible. A vector is an ordered collection of objects. Here, duplicate elements are allowed. Somewhere in the middle lies the *multiset*, which is a collection of objects that supports multiplicity but not order.

This is an attempt at implementing multiset data structures for the Rust collections crate.
